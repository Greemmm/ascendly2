    <td>Setup</td>
    <td>The stream is live, but the camera/mic is off. Use a branded Starting Soon screen with a countdown timer. Check all software (audio levels, game capture, overlays). Review chat rules. Play royalty-free music.</td>

    <td>Gaming Tips</td>
    <td>Gaming tips are important in a stream because they are a form of engaging content that helps attract and retain viewers, build a community, and establish the streamer's credibility and expertise. Viewers often tune in specifically to learn and improve their own gameplay. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>7:30</td>
    <td>1 Hour</td>
    <td>Game Focus</td>
    <td>The main action begins. Focus intensely on the game objective. Engage with chat primarily during downtime (loading screens, dying, inventory management). Answer a Question of the Day (QOTD) if you have one.</td>

    <td>1 Hour</td>

    <td>25 Minutes</td>
    <td>Promotion/Additional Activities</td>
    <td>To finish strong, we will complete the current objective or find a good stopping point, then transition to a Community Chat session to review performance and plan the next stream; before we wrap up, please remember to follow all my social media, and a final thanks goes to the mods and community as we set up the Raid/Host to send traffic to another streamer.</td>
  </tr>
      <tr>
    <td>10:05</td>
    <td>5 Minutes</td>
    <td>Outro</td>
    <td>It provides a professional closing, helps reinforce your brand, encourages viewers to take the next action (like subscribing or watching another video), and leaves a lasting positive impression. Without a proper outro, a stream can feel abrupt, leaving viewers unsure of what to do next. </td>
